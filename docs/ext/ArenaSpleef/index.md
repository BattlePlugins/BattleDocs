A Spleef plugin where players can queue and will join a free Spleef arena. You can make more than one Spleef arena and players will cycle through them. If all arenas are in use, the players are kept in the queue and will join when one opens up. You can modify all aspects of the spleef by editing the SpleefConfig.yml. Including what items they get for the spleef, whether they get prizes, etc.
