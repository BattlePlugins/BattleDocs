You can join all games in a team so that you can play with friends. To do this you have to "create" your team then join one of the games. (A game might break you up if needed, but it will try to respect the teams if possible)

# Creating a team

Say you have a friend named ZeroCool. You should type the following

- `/team create ZeroCool` Your friend will then have to type
- `/team join` or if he doesnt want to join the team then
- `/team decline` If he accepts then you can now join a game as a team simply by one of you typing the command
- `/<game> join`

# Team Commands

- `/team info`
- `/team decline`
- `/team disband`
- `/team join`
- `/team create <player 1> <player 2>...<player x>`
