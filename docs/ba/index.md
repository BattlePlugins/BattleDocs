## Add-On Plugins

These are all the dependencies that are currently built into BattleArena right now! We're always open for new suggestions or ideas, please reach out on [Discord](https://discord.gg/tMVPVJf) or [Github](https://github.com/BattlePlugins/BattleArena/issues/new)!

### Types

These are the three different levels of dependencies that are built into BattleArena:

-   **Soft Dependencies**: These are not required plugins, they'll hook into BattleArena if they're running compatible versions side by side to extend your experience.
-   **Rec Dependencies**: These are recommended dependencies, we strongly recommend running these along with BattleArena as they'll vastly expand BAs core features.
-   **Hard Dependencies**: You need to run these side by side with BattleArena. Thankfully, we don't have any of those and don't plan too!
