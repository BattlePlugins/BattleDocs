[^1]: Soft Dependencies: These are not required plugins, they'll hook into BattleArena if they're running compatible versions side by side to extend your experience.
[^2]: Rec Dependencies: We strongly recommend running these along with BattleArena as they'll vastly expand BAs core features.
[^3]: Hard Dependencies: You need to run these side by side with BattleArena. Thankfully, we don't have any of those and don't plan too!
