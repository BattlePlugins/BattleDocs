Credits VirtualPlayers was originally developed by alkarinv. All credits for the original plugin goes to him. :)

WorldEdit Compatibility VirtualPlayers2 is fully compatible with WorldEdit v5.x but unfortunately, it is NOT compatible with WE v6.x. I have compiled a special version of WorldEdit v6 that works with VirtualPlayers:

Quote: These builds have not been approved by the BukkitDev staff. Use them at your own risk. <http://rainbowcraft.sytes.net/download/plugins/WorldEdit/v6.1.1-SNAPSHOT/>

If anyone wants to use VirtualPlayers to execute WorldEdit & WorldGuard commands, then you can download the above WorldEdit. Or you can use any v5.x version.

Here is the source code (& changes) if you wish to compile it yourself:
